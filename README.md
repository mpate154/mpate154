## Hi Techies! 👋

### Get to know me! 😄
Hello! My name is Maya Patel and I'm a junior at Stevens Institute of Tech! I'm majoring in CS and minoring in Data Visualization. 📊

With my love for art, graphic visuals, web dev, and storytelling I found data and web development to go hand in hand. My projects span these interests and even overlap!
